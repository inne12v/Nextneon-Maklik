<h1>Intro</h1>

Welcome to Nextneon Maklik.
I build an Linux distro based on Ubuntu using Cubic.
Because i didn't change all files in the disk, you will see very much details of that it is just a little change of ubuntu.
I am working on that, but this project is not just because so that it is really very different from ubuntu, but it is made for people who need an intro to open-source software.
Most of the software *i* installed is open-source.
It has many apps installed, so this is not recommended on old laptops.
There are apps installed such as VScodium, Bottles, Audacity, Flameshot, Lollypop, etc.
Because i use an compression format which has results in really big iso's, you get an really big iso.
For the real source (because i just changed things in the terminal) check out: https://github.com/ubuntu
It's theme is changing. I am working on arcmenu and dash-to-panel.
It's now straight-out an ubuntu theme, but i am tweaking it to a more windows-like experience, but i am keeping the dock on the dock.
